# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for how OctoAcme delivers software projects—from initial concept through deployment and continuous improvement. Our approach emphasizes customer value, iterative delivery, clear ownership, and data-informed decision-making. These principles guide every project, ensuring that teams can collaborate effectively while maintaining high standards for quality and transparency.

OctoAcme's project lifecycle follows five key phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Each phase has defined deliverables, decision gates, and quality checkpoints. During Initiation, teams validate the business need and create a project one-pager with clear success metrics. Planning translates that vision into an actionable backlog with estimated tasks, dependencies, and release milestones. Execution focuses on building, testing, and iterating in small increments, supported by daily standups and weekly delivery syncs. Release and Deployment follow standardized practices to minimize risk, including pre-release checklists, smoke tests, and rollback plans. Finally, Retrospectives capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements for future work.

Cross-functional collaboration is central to OctoAcme's success. Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications, while Product Managers define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure impact. Developers implement features and maintain code quality through comprehensive testing and code reviews. QA/Testing roles validate acceptance criteria and ensure robust quality gates. Stakeholders provide essential inputs and approvals throughout the process. This clear division of responsibilities, combined with regular communication cadences—including weekly PM-PdM syncs, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates—ensures alignment and reduces surprises.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout the development process. Teams follow defined workflows using project boards with clear states (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done). Pull requests are kept small and must include issue links, acceptance criteria, and passing automated tests before review. Continuous integration runs unit tests, integration tests, and security scans on every change. Risk management is proactive, with teams maintaining risk registers that are reviewed weekly and escalation paths that ensure blockers are addressed quickly. This disciplined approach to process, communication, and quality enables OctoAcme to deliver reliable software efficiently while fostering a culture of psychological safety and continuous learning.
